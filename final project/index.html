            paragraph1="In England, historically, people were incarcerated for only a short time, before 
            being dragged out and whipped in the street. As Angela Davis narrates in her 2003 book, “Are 
            Prisons Obsolete?” while early English common law deemed the crime of petty treason punishable 
            by being burned alive, by 1790 this punishment was reformed to death by hanging. In the wake of 
            the Enlightenment, European reformers gradually moved away from corporal punishment tout court; 
            people would go to prison for a set period of time, rather than to wait for the punishment to 
            come. The penitentiary movement in both England and the United States in the early 19th century 
            was motivated in part by the demand for more humanitarian punishment. Prison was the reform."
            paragraph2="There are those who emphasize frontend measures like improving public education, job 
            creation, and more equitable community investment; still others who advocate abolishing carceral 
            systems altogether. These are critical and essential battles—but what of the millions of justice-
            involved people our society has already failed, who are incarcerated or have been incarcerated, 
            and are not prepared for higher education or living wage work? Prisons education is incredibly 
            important to give a fighting chance to those whom the system has repeatedly failed."

            alt="#BlackLivesMatter  #DefundThePolice"
            paragraph1="There is not a single era in United States history in which the police were not a 
            force of violence against black people. Policing in the South emerged from the slave patrols 
            in the 1700 and 1800s that caught and returned runaway slaves. In the North, the first municipal 
            police departments in the mid-1800s helped quash labor strikes and riots against the rich. 
            Everywhere, they have suppressed marginalized populations to protect the status quo."
            paragraph2="Still today, the role of police is not entirely to catch “bad guys”; they generally 
            respond to noise complaints, issuing parking, and traffic citations, with just 1-2 felony charges 
            a year. These open up opportunities to segregate and discriminate against the black community and 
            other marginalized communities in the name of “good.” Some feel that the proper approach to police 
            reform is to defund the police system entirely; others hope to help repair the fractured relationship 
            between American communities and their law enforcement by supporting good cops and demanding 
            accountability for bad cops."

            paragraph1="In the mid-1800s Asian immigrants were recruited as laborers to work as farm 
                laborers and on the first transcontinental railroad. They were despised laborers who toiled 
                for low wages in the harshest of conditions. Confucian values were not seen as the key to 
                success, but as a marker of racial and religious differences. Eventually, most Asians were 
                excluded from immigration altogether due to fears of racial contamination."
            paragraph2="Although there has been a shift in the meaning and power assigned to Asian Americans
            --”from uneducated and unwanted scourge to hardworking students and examples of economic success”
            --we are ignoring that a passive form of marginalization that stems from a historical system of
            racial injustice can still greatly harm Asian Americans even if explicit discrimination and hatred 
            is not the reason they are being targeted."

            paragraph1="Yang notes that laws and election management practices — some of which limit the 
            availability of ballots in different languages, have strong photo ID restrictions, and scrutinize 
            the ballots of voters who are naturalized citizens — have all negatively affected Asian American 
            voters. Organizations working with other marginalized communities, including Latino voters, black 
            voters, and Native American voters, have also noted that other racial groups are disproportionately 
            affected by restrictions passed in the six years since Shelby."
            paragraph2="Since the Shelby vs. Holder case ruling which challenged the constitutionality of 
            Sections 4b and 5 removing voter preclearance, there has been an adverse impact on voters of color 
            by states that have been able to pass restrictions that result in the suppression of these 
            voters, leading voting rights advocates to promote the restoration of the Voting Rights Act."

            alt="#MeToo"
            paragraph1="Although feminists have long championed public speak-outs for survivors of sexual 
            violence — whether in Take Back the Night open mics since the 1980s or the workshops also called 
            “MeToo” that Tarana Burke started in Alabama in 2007 — the viral force of the hashtag #MeToo in 
            mid-October 2017 took most people by surprise. Within the first twenty-four hours, it had been 
            retweeted half a million times. According to Facebook, nearly 50 percent of US users are 
            friends with someone who posted a message about experiences of assault or harassment."
            paragraph2="To answer what makes coercion in workplaces so common, we need to look at the factors 
            that generate cis-male dominance in the workplace: historical wage discrimination, childcare 
            policies, and the way skills are defined and valued in masculinist ways. When men are systematically 
            privileged by workplace policies and practices, they regularly ascend to powerful positions. We 
            need to re-script misogynistic practices that make it difficult for women to inhabit these roles 
            in the first place. And we need to stop focusing on punishment and focus on transforming workplace 
            hierarchies."

            paragraph1="It has been one year since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 landmark ruling that 
            extended marriage equality to millions of LGBT people across the country, but the U.S. 
            Constitution still does not explicitly guarantee equality on the basis of sexual orientation 
            and gender identity. A legal grey area has allowed for the state governments to react in the 
            form of discriminatory bills."
            paragraph2="Although LGBT individuals in the US now have marriage equality, they still 
            continue to experience discrimination in other atmospheres such as work and housing. 
            There is still more work that needs to be done in order to guarantee protection from 
            discrimination and all around equal rights to LGBT individuals in America in all aspects 
            of life."
